## Version 6.1 ([Latest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jivoin.FlappyMcKain))
### Bugfixes
- Tracking average score is incompatible with Play Games leaderboards since it only saves the highest reported score. The data is being tracked just in case this changes on Google's end in the future. The leaderboard has been removed.
